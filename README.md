This project uses a series of scripts, a Raspberry Pi, and a relay to remotely start a Minecraft server. Anyone given the main program and their IP allowed will be able to turn on the computer as well as the Minecraft server.
This is done using SSH to remotely access scripts located on both the Raspberry Pi and Minecraft server itself.
